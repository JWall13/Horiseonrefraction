# Code Refactor Starter Code

Description:  Thank you for reading me.  This is my first real attempt at refracting starter code, so hopefully it will work out okay.  No need for a code of conduct or guidelines here since it's just an assignment, but I figure I should mention those anyways.  This is my refracting of the main website for Horiseon, a company providing web marketing services.  I did my best, now do your worst.  

Here is a link to my deployed application (I think...):  https://jwall13.github.io/Horiseonrefraction/

And at the moment, I cannot figure out how to do a screenshot with the entire site visible.  Hopefully, I will get that figured out in tutoring.
